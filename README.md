# Google_Summer_of_Code_2023_OpenCV_Optical_Flow_Summary
This is a summary of my contributions to OpenCV library under Google Summer of Code 2023.
## The project main goal is adding a deep-learning optical flow model to OpenCV. 
Using KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite, we short-listed three models, which were RAFT-it+_RVC, GMFlow, and MatchFlow based on running time and accuracy. We decided to use the RAFT model for two main reasons: first is the fact that it's the basis for various optical flow models, and second is the availability of the model's ONNX version. <br>
To convert RAFT from ONNX to run with OpenCV DNN, the GatherElements operator had to be added to OpenCV DNN module. The first [pull request](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/24092) was simply implmentating the operator in OpenCV DNN module. Then, this was followed by a [second pull request](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_extra/pull/1082) to OpenCV_extra to add data for testing the implementation of GatherElements. At the same time, a [third pull request](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_zoo/pull/197) was submitted to OpenCV_zoo to add the RAFT model along with a demo and example for inputs and outputs using the ONNX version of the RAFT model. And after the GatherElements operator passed the tests, the [OpenCV_zoo pull request](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_zoo/pull/197) was updated to use OpenCV DNN to run the RAFT model. Afterwards, the [first OpenCV pull request](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/24092) was updated to test the RAFT model and the [second OpenCV_extra pull request](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_extra/pull/1082) was updated to add data for testing the RAFT model.
